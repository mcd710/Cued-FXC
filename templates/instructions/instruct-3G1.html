                When you play the role of COLLECTOR, you will create gems.

                At the start of each turn, there is a new empty container to fill. 
                <br><br>
                You will create some amount of gems every time you provide correct response to a colored word you saw earlier. However, the amount of gems you create per correct response depends on the value of colored words on that turn.
                <br><br>
                When you are on a <b>LOW-VALUE</b> turn, each correct response on that turn creates only <span id='lowValue'></span> gem.
                <br>
                When you are on a <b>HIGH-VALUE</b> turn, each correct response on that turn creates <span id='highValue'></span> gems. 
                <br><br>
                <b>NOTICE:</b> You will neither create nor lose any gems when you give an incorrect response.
