                The game will be broken up into turns, and each turn will be about 5 seconds long, so the faster you respond, the more words you can respond to. 
                <br><br>
                Each turn will start with one of the colored words you saw earlier. Once you respond to that word, a new word will appear. This will keep happening until the time for that turn runs out.
                <br/><br/>
                You will no longer see the words ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ after each response.
                <br/><br/>
                Instead, at the bottom of the board you will see a tracker which will track the number of correct responses.
                <br/><br/>
                Importantly, you should continue to respond only to the <strong>INK COLOR</strong> of each word. You should  <strong>NOT</strong> respond based on the content of the word.
