                Every so often after a turn you will be also be asked: 
                <br/><br/>
                How often do you think you are currently collecting fruit and earning coins? 
                <br/><br/>
                If you move the slider to the left this means you think you have never collected fruit and not earned coins during the past few turns. 
                <br/><br/>
                If you move the slider to the right this means you think you have always collected fruit and earned coins during the past few turns.
