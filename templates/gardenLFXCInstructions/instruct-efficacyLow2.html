                Every turn, you will continue to see a fruit tree image. It will ALWAYS be a PERFORMANCE Tree.
                <br/><br/>
                Every turn there are also RANDOM Trees, but you will never see a fruit image for a RANDOM Tree because they do NOT require you to water them to  produce fruit. 
                <br/><br/>
                RANDOM Trees produce fruit which you can collect at the end of the turn randomly and not based on your watering performance during the turn.
                <br/><br/>
                However, you will not know if you can collect fruit from the RANDOM Trees until the end of a turn. 
                <br/><br/>
                If you are collecting fruit from the RANDOM Trees at the end of the turn you will see this image: 
            </p>

            <table class='table table-bordered table-striped text-center'>
              <tr>
                <td style="padding:10px"><img src='{{ server_location }} static/images/cues/efficacyGarden/random.png' height="200"></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p >  
                This image means the amount of fruit you collected and the number of coins you earned was NOT based on how well you watered the PERFORMANCE Trees during the turn.
